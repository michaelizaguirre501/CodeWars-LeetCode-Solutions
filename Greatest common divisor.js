//Instructions
// Find the greatest common divisor of two positive integers. The integers can be large, so you need to find a clever solution.
// The inputs x and y are always greater or equal to 1, so the greatest common divisor will always be an integer that is also greater or equal to 1.

//Solution-- 
// not gunna lie stack overflow. i was close but i didnt utilize the loop 


function mygcd(x, y) {
    while (y)[x, y] = [y, x % y];
    return x;

}
